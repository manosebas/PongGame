# Pong Game

## Description
This project is a simple recreation of the classic Pong game, developed using Processing.

It features basic paddle and ball mechanics, with two-player controls using the keyboard.

Players can control their paddles to bounce the ball back and forth, with the objective of scoring points by getting the ball past the opponentâ€™s paddle.

The game includes score tracking, collision detection, and basic physics for realistic ball movement.

This project serves as an example of how to implement fundamental game mechanics in a straightforward and effective manner.
